Sudoku Validator - README

This program checks Sudoku solutions using multi-threading techniques to improve performance, especially for larger Sudoku grids. It checks the validity of rows, columns, and subgrids, using approaches like sequential processing, chunk-based processing, and a mixed method. The program is designed to handle different Sudoku grid sizes (e.g., 9x9, 16x16, 25x25, etc.)

input.txt: Input file containing the Sudoku grid.
output.txt: Output file that contains the final results and execution time.
